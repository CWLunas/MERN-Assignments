Create a database called 'my_first_db'.
use my_first_db

Create students collection.
db.createCollection("students")

Each document you insert into this collection should have the following format: ({name: STRING, home_state: STRING, lucky_number: NUMBER, birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER, year: NUMBER}})
db.students.insert({name: "Ross", home_state: "California", lucky_number: 5, birthday: {month: 7, day: 5, year: 2000}})
db.students.insert({name: "Terry", home_state: "Washington", lucky_number: 9, birthday: {month: 3, day: 22, year: 1992}})
db.students.insert({name: "Bill", home_state: "California", lucky_number: 2, birthday: {month: 6, day: 1, year: 2003}})
db.students.insert({name: "Zoe", home_state: "Washington", lucky_number: 11, birthday: {month: 11, day: 11, year: 1978}})
db.students.insert({name: "Max", home_state: "California", lucky_number: 7, birthday: {month: 9, day: 25, year: 2002}})

Get all students.
db.students.find()

Retrieve all students who are from California (San Jose Dojo) or Washington (Seattle Dojo).
db.students.find({$or: [{home_state: "California"}, {home_state: "Washington"}]})

Get all students whose lucky number is greater than 3
db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gt: 3}})

Get all students whose lucky number is less than or equal to 10
db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte: 10}})

Get all students whose lucky number is between 1 and 9 (inclusive)
db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gte: 1, $lte: 9}})

Add a field named 'interests' to all student documents in the collection. The field should be an array and contain the following entries: 'coding', 'brunch', MongoDB'. Add this field to all documents using a single command.
db.students.updateMany({}, {$set: {interests: ["coding", "brunch", "MongoDB"]}})

Add some unique interests for each particular student into each of their interest arrays.
db.students.update({name: "John"}, {$push: {interests: "reading"}})
db.students.update({name: "Jane"}, {$push: {interests: "hiking"}})
db.students.update({name: "Bob"}, {$push: {interests: "gaming"}})
db.students.update({name: "Alice"}, {$push: {interests: "painting"}})
db.students.update({name: "Tom"}, {$push: {interests: "music"}})

Add the interest 'taxes' into someone's interest array.
db.students.update({name: "John"}, {$push: {interests: "taxes"}})

Remove the 'taxes' interest you just added.
db.students.updateOne({ name: 'Alice' }, { $pull: { interests: 'taxes' } })

Remove all students who are from California:
db.students.remove({ home_state: 'CA' })

Remove a student by name:
db.students.remove({ name: 'John' })

Remove a student whose lucky number is greater than 5 (JUST ONE):
db.students.deleteOne({ lucky_number: { $gt: 5 } })

Add a field to each student document called 'number_of_belts' and set it to 0:
db.students.updateMany({}, { $set: { number_of_belts: 0 } })

Increment this field by 1 for all students in Washington (Seattle Dojo):
db.students.updateMany({ home_state: 'WA' }, { $inc: { number_of_belts: 1 } })

Rename the 'number_of_belts' field to 'belts_earned':
db.students.updateMany({}, { $rename: { "number_of_belts": "belts_earned" } })

Remove the 'lucky_number' field:
db.students.updateMany({}, { $unset: { lucky_number: "" } })

Add a 'updated_on' field, and set the value as the current date:
db.students.updateMany({}, { $currentDate: { updated_on: true } })
